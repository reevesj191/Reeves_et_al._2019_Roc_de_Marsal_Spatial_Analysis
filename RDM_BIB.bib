abstract = {The 3D orientation of clasts within a deposit are known to be informative on processes that formed that deposit. In archaeological sites, a portion of the clasts in the deposit are introduced by non-geological processes, and these are typically systematically recorded in archaeological excavations with total stations. By recording a second point on elongated clasts it is possible to quickly and precisely capture their orientation. The statistical and graphical techniques for analyzing these data are well published, and there is a growing set of actualistic and archaeological comparative data to help with the interpretation of the documented patterns. This paper advances this area of research in presenting methods to address some shortcomings in current methodologies. First, a method for calculating confidence intervals on orientation statistics is presented to help address the question of how many objects are needed to assess the formation of a deposit based on orientations. Second, a method for assessing the probability that two assemblages have different orientations is presented based on permutations testing. This method differs from existing ones in that it considers three-dimensional orientations rather than working separately with the two-dimensional bearing and plunge components. Third, a method is presented to examine spatial variability in orientations based on a moving windows approach. The raw data plus the R code to build this document and to implement these methods plus those already described by McPherron are included to help further their use in assessing archaeological site formation processes.},

This limits the progress of archaeology because researchers cannot easily reproduce each other's work to verify or extend it. Four general principles of reproducible research that have emerged in other fields are presented. An archaeological case study is described that shows how each principle can be implemented using freely available software. The costs and benefits of implementing reproducible research are assessed. The primary benefit, of sharing data in particular, is increased impact via an increased number of citations. The primary cost is the additional time required to enhance reproducibility, although the exact amount is difficult to quantify.},

abstract = {Over the past five decades, archaeologists have proposed a wide range of methods for the study of spatial organization within hunter-gatherer sites. Many of these methods sought to identify the spatial location of activities based on patterns of behavior observed in ethnographic contexts. While this resulted in productive observations at certain sites, many of these methods were tailored to specific situations and thus could not be applied to a wide range of sites. For example, open-air sites rarely contain preserved bone or features, such as hearths, which were central components to identifying characteristics of site structure. In addition, many of these methods often did not take into consideration the temporal dynamics of the occupation, i.e., that many sites were formed through subsequent occupations of differing duration. This paper proposes the use of two related methods that assume many assemblages are the result of more than one occupation. The methods target the distribution of lithic artifacts, the most ubiquitously preserved of archaeological materials, and accounts for the potential that the final resting place of artifacts was the result of both intentional and unintentional movement by humans and a host of biological and geological processes. The main goal of this paper is to use an understanding of how these processes influenced the formation of site structure to estimate the relative number and duration of occupations for each site in the sample. These new methods will be presented and explained through the study of seven open-air Middle Paleolithic sites in France but are applicable to a wide range of hunter-gatherer sites.},

abstract = {While lithic objects can potentially inform us about past adaptations and behaviors, it is important to develop a comprehensive understanding of all of the various processes that influence what we recover from the archaeological record. We argue here that many assumptions used by archaeologists to derive behavioral inferences through the definition, conceptualization, and interpretation of both individual stone artifact forms and groups of artifacts identified as assemblages do not fit squarely with what we have learned from both ethnographic sources and analyses of archaeological materials. We discuss this in terms of two fallacies. The first is the fallacy of the ``desired end product'' in stone artifact manufacture, which also includes our ability to recognize such end products. The second fallacy has to do with the notions that lithic assemblages represent simple accumulations of contemporary behaviors and the degree to which the composition of the depositional units we study reliably match the kinds of activities that took place. Although it is beyond the scope of this paper to offer a comprehensive set of new methodologies and theoretical perspectives to solve these problems, our goal here is to stress the importance of rethinking some of our most basic assumptions regarding the nature of lithic objects and how they become part of the archaeological record. Such a revision is needed if we want to be able to develop research questions that can be addressed with the data we have available to us.},

abstract = {The use of fire by early hominins is considered a significant technological and cultural revolution. Recently, the study of fire use has been affected by a troublesome trend that views chemical and microscopic techniques as the only ac- ceptable analyses of fire residues, thus ignoring basic archaeological observations and analyses. This paper discusses the diverse expressions of early fire, their variability, and their level of significance and suggests that the spatial analysis of burned residues is a reliable method for recognizing early fire. Evidence from the site of Gesher Benot Ya‘aqov (GBY) suggests that fire was routinely used by Acheulian hominins. In addition, new data on the spatial association between percussive activities and fire are presented. Such evidence of routine and habitual use of fire requires intensity and recurrence, documented in sites with long occupational sequences such as GBY. This requirement excludes habitual use of fire from the majority of early hominin habitations, documented by short-term occupations of open-air sites. To deny Early to Middle Pleistocene hominins of the habitual use of fire is to ignore the archaeological record of their evolution, behavior, and culture.},

abstract = {While it is true that the use of fire is undoubtedly an important behavioral trait, fire can also leave important traces in archaeological deposits, including altering previously deposited sediments and artifacts. The set of controlled experiments reported here do not focus on fire per se, but rather on the effects of some of the most important variables underlying the transfer of heat to subsurface sediments. These variables, including temperature, duration, sediment type, moisture, and mineralogy, are altered here in ways that essentially bracket the range of conditions under which past fires may have existed. The results show that sediments as much as 10 cm directly below a heat source routinely reach temperatures of 200 °C, with higher temperatures and greater depth of heat transfer possible with longer durations or higher surface temperatures. One of the implications of these results is that a surface can produce substantial thermal-alterations of archaeological artifacts and sediments deposited much earlier in the sequence. Likewise, there are significant implications for the analyses and chronometric dating of thermally altered sediments and burned artifacts.},

However, it remains difficult to distinguish objectively the effect of either factor in archaeological contexts without controlling for the variation in one of the two variables. Here we report on an experimental study designed to test the null hypotheses that original stone size and reduction intensity have no impact on the size distribution of lithic flake debris produced during core reduction. Results indicate statistically significant influence from original stone size but not reduction intensity, although the effects from the former are low enough to be considered trivial. In reviewing a sequence of archaeological assemblages from a Middle Paleolithic site, all exhibit an excess of smallsized materials in comparison to the experimental data. When exceptionally high frequencies of the smaller size classes occur, taphonomic processes are clearly responsible.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Qesem Cave is a karst chamber cave with a {\~{}}10 m stratigraphic sequence assigned to the Acheulo-Yabrudian Cultural Complex (AYCC) of the late Lower Paleolithic in the Levant dated to 420-200 ka.We first show the range of lithic densities in studied assemblages in the cave emphasizing significant differences in both the total number of lithic items per volume unit and/or for selected artifact categories within these assemblages. The results are used to suggest differential intensity of lithic-related activities in the cave and variability in synchronic (different areas of the cave within a similar stratigraphic level) distribution aspects of lithic categories of selected assemblages. We briefly note on the diachronic (assemblages belonging to different parts of the stratigraphic sequence) aspect of lithic densities in the discussion, yet this aspect is not is not central in this paper.A comparison of densities to frequency compositions of selected techno-typological categories in the same assemblages/areas further emphasizes the importance of using more than one quantitative measure as a descriptor of lithic assemblages and the interpretative potential of the interplay between the two measures. In some analyzed aspects the differences between the two measures in the same assemblage are quite significant, enabling interpretation of activity areas and specific human behaviors.Eventually, further research testing lithic densities against and/or incorporating them with other sets of density (and frequency) data from the same areas (e.g., faunal remains), or relating these densities to natural (such as a rock shelf) or human made features (such as a fireplace), may offer an elaborate and valuable landscape for reconstructing human behavior at the cave. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of specific techno-typological lithic categories within the assemblages studied as seen in densities augmented by available functional data (derived from use-wear analysis) enable another perspective on the subdivision of activity areas in some parts of the sequence.One synchronic example of our preliminary results which we present relates to generally contemporaneous assemblages adjacent to a constructed fireplace in the center of the cave in the upper part of the lower stratigraphic sequence dated to ca. 300 ka. Both blade-dominated Amudian and Quina (and demi Quina) scrapers dominated Yabrudian assemblages are involved, indicating spatially differentiated, functionally related differences around the fireplace.},

abstract = {The technological innovation involving the controlled use of fire represents a decisive change in human subsistence. Hearths and the spatial distribution patterns associated with them constitute a valuable element in deepening our knowledge on human behaviour and its evolution. Studies focused on hearths and on the use of fire in general are diverse and carried out through different perspectives. Thus, hearths are studied for their meaning in terms of diet, caloric and light capacity and spatial organisation as well as for their role as communication and socialization focal points. The site of Qesem Cave (Israel) shows evidence of the controlled use of fire as early as 400 ka, judging by the burned bones from the lowest units of the stratigraphic sequence. A particular superimposed central hearth that was repeatedly used as a focus for human activities ca. 300 ka is the topic of this study. This succession of hearths at the same location in the cave yields dense faunal and lithic remains as well as evidence for spatial differentiation between areas. Here, we present faunal taphonomical data from this specific archaeological context, which includes not only the hearth area (approximately 4 m2) but also the surrounding areas (approximately 11 m2). The most common prey species is the Mesopotamian fallow deer (Dama cf. mesopotamica), which displays a wide age range and a biased anatomical profile including mainly marrow-rich bones such as long-limb bones. These characteristics, especially those regarding the relative abundance of infantile and young fallow deer, lead us to propose that social hunting techniques were practised following a seasonal regime. This paper provides data on human subsistence behaviour during the formation of the hearth and the archaeological unit around it, comparing the two from a taphonomical perspective. Elements such as size (length) of bone fragments and intensity of burning are spatially plotted to show differential space division. All these data are considered in the reconstruction of subsistence strategies and hominin behaviour in the Acheulo-Yabrudian Cultural Complex in the Levant.},

This study seeks to access this information through a comparison of seven sites. These sites are open-air and were all excavated over large spatial areas, up to 2,000 m2, and are therefore ideal for spatial analysis, which was done using two complementary methods, lithic refitting and density zones. Both methods were assessed statistically using confidence intervals. The statistically significant results from each site were then compiled to evaluate trends that occur across the seven sites. These results were used to assess the �spatial consistency� of each assemblage and, through that, the number and duration of occupations. This study demonstrates that spatial analysis can be a powerful tool in research on occupation dynamics and can help disentangle the many occupations that often make up an archeological assemblage.},

abstract = {Cultural deposits, especially those accumulated in caves and rock shelters, are usually the results of several occupational events in the same space, forming palimpsests. In addition, the materials of these occupational events tend to be deposited along with remains of natural origin and may be altered, partially destroyed or reworked due to the process of superimposition. The work presented here focuses on dissecting the palimpsest of level O at Abric Roman{\'{i}} through an interdisciplinary analysis. We analyzed a particular area, located in the northeastern corner of the site. This work is based on the study of the lithic and faunal remains recovered in this area, with the aim of dissecting the palimpsest into the smallest possible units. To do this, we used different methods and techniques including archaeostratigraphy, intra-site spatial archaeology, zooarchaeology, tooth microwear, taphonomy, lithic technology, and faunal and lithic refits. These methods allowed us to identify two archaeolevels in this area (Oa and Ob). Oa comprises a maximum of three accumulations and Ob holds two accumulations of archaeological remains. These accumulations are generally related to combustion structures. Based on the results obtained from zooarchaeological, taphonomic and lithic technology analyses, we characterized each accumulation. The analysis of the lithic and faunal refits helped to identify synchronic and diachronic links. After having processed all of the results, we were able to interpret the intra-area organization and its role in relation to the rest of the site. Our results have shown that it is possible to obtain high-resolution data for dissecting a palimpsest using different methodologies. It is, however, important to remember that although we were able to distinguish these finer units, we were still working with palimpsests. Nevertheless, the study of these finer units makes it possible to work with time scales that are closer to ethnographic time, thereby facilitating further ethno-archaeological interpretation.},

abstract = {Stone tool transport leaves long-lasting behavioural evidence in the landscape. However, it remains unknown how large-scale patterns of stone distribution emerge through undirected, short-term transport behaviours. One of the longest studied groups of stone-tool-using primates are the chimpanzees of the Ta{\{}{\"{i}}{\}} National Park in Ivory Coast, West Africa. Using hammerstones left behind at chimpanzee Panda nut-cracking sites, we tested for a distance-decay effect, in which the weight of material decreases with increasing distance from raw material sources. We found that this effect exists over a range of more than 2 km, despite the fact that observed, short-term tool transport does not appear to involve deliberate movements away from raw material sources. Tools from the millennia-old Noulo site in the Ta{\{}{\"{i}}{\}} forest fit the same pattern. The fact that chimpanzees show both complex short-term behavioural planning, and yet produce a landscape-wide pattern over the long term, raises the question of whether similar processes operate within other stone-tool-using primates, including hominins. Where hominin landscapes have discrete material sources, a distance-decay effect, and increasing use of stone materials away from sources, the Ta{\{}{\"{i}}{\}} chimpanzees provide a relevant analogy for understanding the formation of those landscapes.},

abstract = {The superposition of anthropogenic remains usual- ly results in archaeological palimpsests, hindering an accurate characterization of the behavior underlying such remains. Aimed at facing this methodological constraint in the study of Palaeolithic contexts, we present a contextual approach to Neanderthal settlement dynamics based on an understanding of lithic assemblage formation processes.We focused on a set of lithic artifacts from the Middle Palaeolithic site of El Salt. With the goal of isolating temporally constrained units of be- havioral analysis,we analyzed the spatial distribution of lithic, faunal and combustion remains. Then, the lithic records from each of the resulting units were analyzed from a genetic and technical perspective. This goal was achieved by identifying lithic Raw Material Units (RMU) through observations on reduction processes, refits and their spatial distribution. Our results suggest that El Salt SU X lithic remains represent sev- eral diachronic human occupation episodes and different site functions. This study illustrates the benefit of investigating lithic assemblage formation processes to alleviate the palimp- sest problem in Palaeolithic contexts. *},

Traditional landscape pattern indicators summa-rize an aspect of landscape pattern over the full study area. Increasingly, the advantages of representingthe scale-specific spatial variation of landscape patterns as continuous surfaces are being recognized. However, technical and computational barriers hinder the uptake of this approach. This article reducessuch barriers by introducing a computational framework for moving window analysis that separates thetasks of tallying pixels, patches and edges as a window moves over the map from the internal logic oflandscape indicators. The framework is applied on data covering the UK and Ireland at 250 m resolu-tion, evaluating a variety of indicators including mean patch size, edge density and Shannon diversity atwindow sizes ranging from 2.5 km to 80 km. The required computation time is in the order of secondsto minutes on a regular personal computer. The framework supports rapid development of indicatorsrequiring little coding. The computational efficiency means that methods can be integrated in itera-tive computational tasks such as multi-scale analysis, optimization, sensitivity analysis and simulationmodelling.},

The distinctive geoarchaeological site formation processes of Quneitra, the wealth of lithic and paleontological finds, and the high-resolution spatial data are rare in the very few excavated open-air Levantine Mousterian sites. Quneitra thus provides an excellent example of a well-preserved, short human occupation. The spatial analyses examined different aspects of the archaeological horizon and provided additional evidence for its unique nature and excellent preservation. The present analyses implemented GIS software, and discerns spatial patterning in both stone artifacts and fossil mammal remains. The analyses of these spatial patterns point to a deliberate division of space into activity areas where different artifacts and faunal remains were used in specific locations. Quneitra hence presents evidence for a complex use of space by the site's inhabitants, a behavior that is usually attributed to modern humans. These new data contribute additional insight into our currently increasing knowledge of the cognitive abilities and complex and dynamic behavioral systems of the Middle Paleolithic hominins.},

abstract = {WZM-2, a flint-source on the edge of the Madaba Plateau, Jordan, exemplifies many of the problems archaeologists confront in investigating open-air sites. This site has a complex history of alternating episodes of deposition, erosion and colluvial movement of sediments, as well as bioturbation and recent plowing, that has altered the spatial relationships of artifacts, creating a cumulative palimpsest on the surface, but with limited stratigraphic integrity below surface. Techniques for investigating these types of sites are discussed, including transect surface collections with finds recorded by hand-held GPS units, systematic total collection of grids, and the use of geological and archaeological test trenches. The assemblages obtained by these methods were subject to statistical analysis of technological attributes combined with the identification of typological specimens and techniques of manufacture known to have chronological significance in order to identify the parts of the Paleolithic sequence present. Potentially time-sensitive types were also subject to spatial analysis. With the exception of a spatially limited and un-diagnostic Holocene chipping area at the northeastern end of the site, WZM-2 is primarily a Middle Paleolithic lithic acquisition and processing site, probably dating to MIS-5, with limited evidence of exploitation during the preceding Late Lower Paleolithic Acheulo-Yabrudian and also possibly the Early Middle Paleolithic. This site also extends the known geographical distribution of the Acheulo-Yabrudian to the south and east. Although the disturbed nature of open-air sites such as this limits the types of behavioral information that can be obtained by archaeologists, their location on the paleo-landscape as well as the aggregate characteristics of their assemblages can provide important clues to early hominin land-use, economies including provisioning strategies, and settlement patterns. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.},

abstract = {We present a preliminary analysis of the spatial distribution of various artifact classes in the Late Mousterian levels of Riparo Bombrini (northwest Italy). This work shows the presence of a consistent gap in artifacts across all levels, which is interpreted as reflecting the position ofthe dripline prior to the shelter's collap.se. Hearths are identi-fied in levels Ml-3, M4 and M5, and their position at the back ofthe shelter is similar to that of "sleeping hearths" identified at other Mousterian sites. Lastly, the distribution of artifacts is shown to co-vary with the natvire of the prevalent mobility strategies in use at different times over the site's occupational history. Notably, use of the site as a logistical base camp is correlated with the presence of hearths and the accumulation of noisome debris beyond the dripline and outside of the shelter. Other uses of the site seem to have favored the discard of some classes of artifacts within the shelter itself. This shows that Neanderthals were indeed able to organize their use of space in patterned and somewhat predictable manners, and that the length and nature of their occupation of the rocksheiter need to be taken into account in such analyses.},

Since the emergence of the processual paradigma, this research has been partly based on the use of interpretive frameworks derived from ethnoarcheological sources.

This paper presents the lithic assemblage from level J (ca. 50 ka BP), one of the Middle Paleolithic layers excavated in the Abric Roman{\'{i}} (Capellades, Spain). The study of this assemblage has been carried out from a spatio-temporal perspective, trying to discern two different time scales involved in the formation of the archeological record: the geological time scale of the assemblage-as-a-whole and the ethnographic time scale of the individual events. The results suggest that several domains of lithic variability, like raw material provisioning, artifact transport and spatial patterns, are time-dependent and should be approached taking into account the temporal depth of the archeological assemblages. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.},

Archeological assemblages are temporal constructs, formed by the addition of an unknown number of depositional events. This temporal dimension is also evident at the artifactual level, since single artifacts may undergo different events of modification and/or uses over time. The recycling of previously discarded blanks for tool production is one of the best examples of the temporal nature of artifacts. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the importance of recycling in a Late Upper Paleolithic site, examining a type of artifact - burned tools - that has up to now been little used to approach this issue. Our results suggest that recycling was probably a significant component of Upper Paleolithic provisioning behavior, with important implications in site formation processes and the typological variability of assemblages. The expedient or curated character of recycling is also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A principal behavioral issue in paleoanthropology centers on the degree to which the behaviors of Neanderthals and modern humans may have differed. Efforts to address this problem have employed the analysis of living floors and site structure in which researchers have traditionally emphasized a dichotomy between the site structures thought to distinguish Modern Human and Neanderthal occupations. This thinking links " complex" site structures characterized by several discrete activity areas to Modern Humans, in contrast to the " simple" structure of Neanderthals as seen in single hearths associated with overlapping, generalized activities. Correlations between prehistoric behaviors and site structures, however, may be masked, distorted, and even destroyed by a variety of natural and cultural agencies. Natural post-depositional processes may be associated with bioturbation, cryo-turbation, and the degradation of sediments through wind and water erosion. Both post- and synch-deposition " disturbance" of artifact distributions and features by human activities may involve cleaning, scuffage, and other site alterations. Perhaps the most vexing of problems associated with post-depositional distortion is from subsequent overlapping occupations in which a smearing or blurring of artifact distributions occurs; i.e., the palimpsest problem. Using the results of a multi-year research program of stratified living floors at the Late Levantine Mousterian rockshelter site of Tor Faraj, southern Jordan, an introduction to a partial solution of addressing the palimpsest problem through hearth pattern and ring and sector analyses is described here. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.},

abstract = {Archaeologists are accustomed to considering both the spatial distributions of sites and the temporal distributions of dates as means of analyzing the dynamics of prehistoric societies. However, spatial and temporal approaches have thus far remained largely separate, rather than being combined within a single, unified framework. A formal methodology is outlined that combines univariate kernel density estimation based on radiocarbon dates with bivariate kernel density estimation based on spatial site coordinates; the approach allows archaeologists to arrive at reconstructed land-use distributions through time that not only correct for the problematic issue of site contemporaneity, but also reflect the continuous nature of the archaeological record. The model is implemented using as a data set a series of sites from the Mesolithic of Atlantic Iberia; the results demonstrate that it is capable of providing key insights into changing patterns of land use that are not apparent from either the temporal or the spatial perspective alone.},

abstract = {Deposits in caves and rock-shelters typically occur in the form of low-resolution palimpsests or time-averaged deposits, resulting from the superimposition of repeated and variable episodes of occupation, low rates of sedimentation and mixing by natural and anthropogenic processes. Despite the development of an impressive array of analytical techniques to disentangle these palimpsests into their constituent episodes of occupation, high resolution chronologies and detailed snapshots of activity areas and spatial organization have proved elusive. Here we suggest that, rather than seeing palimpsests as a problem, we take them as they are, as mixtures of materials that may have been actively recognized as such by the prehistoric occupants and deliberately enhanced, providing both physical resources that could be recycled for subsequent use and material cues for a sense of time and place. We illustrate this approach through a comparison of the spatial and material structure of four Upper Palaeolithic cave deposits in Southeast Europe, focusing on hearths and hearth-related distributions of material as clues to the active role of palimpsests in determining the use histories of different places.},

abstract = {This paper begins by reviewing conventional understandings of the historical and archaeological record and questions the lack of problematizing the nature of time in relation to the archive. Drawing on the concept of memory in both mental (testimony) and material terms (trace), the paper argues that we need to address the temporal paradox at the heart of any archive, namely the continuity of the past into the present. Using the concept of palimpsest, the materiality of memory as trace is then explored as a way to understand the intersection of objects and events - and their residues. It is proposed that the trace produces a very different historical ontology to testimony, one that requires different kinds of narrative. Specifically, the residuality that is implicit in the concept of trace references an interia or resilience in the material world where preservation and destruction - memory and forgetting - are entangled with degrees of reversibility to the order of things.

This study emphasizes the importance of three-dimensional intra-site spatial analysis as a means of testing the integrity of archaeological levels, including the identification of palimpsest deposits. A geographical information system (GIS) is applied to a three-dimensional spatial analysis of lithic and bone distributions from Karabi Tamchin, a Middle Palaeolithic site from the Crimea, Ukraine. K-means statistical clustering is combined with a series of data transformations to identify and interpret the vertical and horizontal spatial organization of the site. The results indicate that K-means cluster analysis, used in conjunction with GIS, provides an exceptional method of identifying discrete clusters of archaeological materials in three dimensions. Through an analysis of cluster contents within levels, it is possible to reconstruct and compare patterns of spatial organization at Karabi Tamchin, contributing to current debates regarding the cognitive complexity of Neanderthal populations.

abstract = {This paper presents the culmination of an extensive study of fire-use at the Early and early Middle Pleistocene site of Gesher Benot Ya'aqov. Using software available in the GIS package, we have examined the spatial distribution of burned and unburned flint microartifacts from eight Acheulian archaeological horizons. The results of this study demonstrate that the burned microartifacts are never evenly distributed and dense concentrations are observed. The circumstances that introduced these burned flint artifacts to the archaeological layers are examined, suggesting that anthropogenic rather than natural fires are responsible for the observed patterns. As the evidence for the use of fire is recorded throughout the long stratigraphic sequence, it seems that fire was continually used by the Acheulian hominins of the site. This repetitive use of fire indicates that the hominins of Gesher Benot Ya'aqov had a profound knowledge of fire-making, enabling them to make fire at will. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Engagingly written, and balancing technical detail with intuitive explanations, Complex Adaptive Systems focuses on the key tools and ideas that have emerged in the field since the mid-1990s, as well as the techniques needed to investigate such systems. It provides a detailed introduction to concepts such as emergence, self-organized criticality, automata, networks, diversity, adaptation, and feedback. It also demonstrates how complex adaptive systems can be explored using methods ranging from mathematics to computational models of adaptive agents. John Miller and Scott Page show how to combine ideas from economics, political science, biology, physics, and computer science to illuminate topics in organization, adaptation, decentralization, and robustness. They also demonstrate how the usual extremes used in modeling can be fruitfully transcended.},

abstract = {This paper explores the meaning of time perspectivism, its relationship to other theories of time used in archaeological interpretation, and the ways in which it can be implemented through an analysis of the palimpsest nature of the material world we inhabit. Palimpsests are shown to be a universal phenomenon of the material world, and to form a series of overlapping categories, which vary according to their geographical scale, temporal resolution and completeness of preservation. Archaeological examples are used to show how different types of palimpsest can be analyzed to address different sorts of questions about the time dimension of human experience, and the relationship between different types of processes and different scales of phenomena. Objections to the apparently deterministic and asocial character of time perspectivism, and its apparent neglect of subjective experience and individual action and perception, are dealt with. The line of thinking developed here is used, in its turn, to critique other approaches to the archaeology of time, and conventional understandings of the relationship between past, present and future. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Paleolithic archaeologists have been recording the three-dimensional coordinates of exca- vated artifacts for several decades. These data, however, have been put to limited use. Z, or absolute elevation, in particular, is seldom used in analysis despite the fact that it speaks most directly to one of the more important areas of research we have—namely, behavioral change through time. This article addresses this deficiency in two ways. First, it examines the way in which we record elevations. The point is made that the elevations returned by high-resolution recording systems like total stations provide behavioral and site formation data that tradi- tional recording systems are probably incapable of capturing. Second, elevation data from two Middle Paleolithic sites are used to examine changes in behavioral factors that structure the archaeological record and that apparently take place independent of changes in factors which structure the geological record.},

Although the term clast usually refers to the natural component of a deposit, the artifactual and faunal components are also known to be sensitive to site formation processes. There are a number of ways in which orientations can be recorded and analyzed, and this paper describes how orientations can be recorded as part of piece proveniencing artifacts with a total station. After the method is described, the calculation, statistical analysis and presentation of artifact orientations are considered. The final part of the paper presents orientation data from Pech de l'Az{\'{e}} IV recorded and analyzed in this way. The example demonstrates the effectiveness of the total station method of recording orientations, their sensitivity to site formation processes, and the importance of using multiple methods of data analysis and presentation to assess and interpret patterning. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Although previous studies demonstrate that tests of global spatial autocorrelation can inform interpretations of archaeological data, they do not provide the means to characterize local concentrations of spatially dependent values, or what Kvamme (J. Archaeol. Sci. 17 (1990) 203) called "the particular nature of [the global] trend". Here, local Moran's Iiand G*istatistics are applied to the same set of distributional data to quantitatively characterize spatial autocorrelation of terminal monument dates at the local, not global, scale. The results raise a number of local-scale hypotheses that, though undetected by previous global spatial analyses, might lead to a refined interpretation of the spatial distribution of dated monuments and, by extension, the reorganization of the Classic Maya. In a more general sense, the present application to dated Maya monuments serves as one example of how local spatial statistics can further strengthen distributional archaeological interpretations. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Although such cases are rare, and most Middle Palaeolithic sites are just as informative albeit of lower resolution, an attempt is made to interpret what patterning is available. It can be explained by recourse to nothing more that simple human biomechanics, and inclosed sites, displays a simple spatial organization that does not differ from that of non-human carnivores. The degree of repetition of such patterning suggests that simple spatial organization was an habitual element of the Neanderthal adaptation.},

Recognizing the sensitivity of the results of spatial analyses to the definition of units for which data are collected is critical to characterizing landscapes with minimal bias and avoidance of spurious relationships. We introduce and examine the effect of data aggregation on analysis of landscape structure as exemplified through what has become known, in the statistical and geographical literature, as the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP). The MAUP applies to two separate, but interrelated, problems with spatial data analysis. The first is the "scale problem", where the same set of areal data is aggregated into several sets of larger areal units, with each combination leading to different data values and inferences. The second aspect of the MAUP is the "zoning problem", where a given set of areal units is recombined into zones that are of the same size but located differently, again resulting in variation in data values and, consequently, different conclusions. We conduct a series of spatial autocorrelation analyses based on NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) to demonstrate how the MAUP may affect the results of landscape analysis. We conclude with a discussion of the broaderscale implications for the MAUP in landscape ecology and suggest approaches for dealing with this issue.},

While much ecological research is narrowly focused and experimental, providing detailed information that cannot be used to generalize from one ecological community or time period to another, macroecology draws on data from many disciplines to create a less detailed but much broader picture with greater potential for generalization. Integrating data from ecology, systematics, evolutionary biology, paleobiology, and biogeography to investigate problems that could only be addressed on a much smaller scale by traditional approaches, macroecology provides a richer, more complete understanding of how patterns of life have moved across the earth over time. Brown also demonstrates the advantages of macroecology for conservation, showing how it allows scientists to look beyond endangered species and ecological communities to consider the long history and large geographic scale of human impacts. An important reassessment of the direction of ecology by one of the most influential thinkers in the field, this work will shape future research in ecology and other disciplines."This approach may well mark a major new turn in the road in the history of ecology, and I find it extremely exciting.

@article{Anselin1995,
abstract = {The capabilities for uisualization, rapid data retrieval, and manipulation in geographic informution systems (GIS) have created the need for new techniques of exploratory data analysis that focus on the “spatial” aspects of the data. The identifcation of local patterns of spatial assocktion is an important concern in this respect. In this paper, I outline a new general class of local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and show how they allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation. The LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G: statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identifiy “outliers,” as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial eualuation of the properties of a LISA statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of confict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations},

@misc{Petraglia1994,
abstract = {Archeologists have typically judged the effects of water flow on sites in terms of the simple dichotomy between primary and secondary (or derived) context. An assumption behind this dichotomy is that artifact assemblages (and associated bones and other remains) located in low energy settings (e.g., fine sediments, lakeshore margins) can be directly related to early human activities, while assemblages in high energy settings (e.g., coarse sediments, river banks) offer little information about behavior. In this paper criteria are examined that may prove effective in distinguishing the diverse influences potentially exerted by flowing water on artifact assemblages. These criteria are used to analyze lithic assemblages from five excavated sites in Olduvai Gorge (1.8-1.2 my). The Olduvai sites are placed on a relative scale of influence by water flow. By assessing the variable effects of moving water on archeological sites, a more informed perspective is expected about the potential behavioral content of early human sites. {\textcopyright} 1994 Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract = {Indications that shifts in diet, foraging strategics and land use patterns were driving forces in hominid evolution are largely responsible for archaeologists' longstanding interest in reconstructing the land use patterns of early tool-using hominids. Attempts to reconstruct past land use patterns involve a study of the distribution of material remains through sediments representing different portions of an ancient landscape. Depositional systems play a major role in structuring these types of regional archaeological records. There is, for example, an inverse relationship between the area of an ancient landscape being sampled, the quantity of archaeological debris available for study and the amount of time represented by that debris and its encasing sediments. The micro-stratigraphy and time resolution of a set of archaeological remains in the lower Okote Member of the Koobi Fora Formation are described. It is argued that this record comprises time-averaged palimpsests of debris spanning 65 ± 5 k.y.a. Only by ignoring the time dimension of these data is it possible to invoke interpretive theories that are based on ethnographic scale observations of the interactions between individuals and their environments. It is argued that serious consideration should be given to the suggestion that this is an ontologically singular record of hominid action with the potential to provide an entirely unique perspective on the history of the hominid lineage.},

abstract = {Since the late igth century archaeologists have struggled to un- derstand the behavioural significance of material remains surviv- ing from the distant reaches of time. A study of the archaeologi- cal debris scattered through the lower Okote Member of the Koobi Fora Formation in northwestern Kenya reveals a serious mismatch between the interpretive models being applied to the earliest archaeological data and the empirical structure of those data. Both the low-density scatters and the high-density patches that make up this record are palimpsests of material remains that accumulated over tens of thousands of years. There is a re- markable similarity in the composition and characteristics of the archaeological assemblages recovered from the scatters and the patches. Both represent the material residues of many different and unrelated behavioural episodes, influenced by a different set of variables to those that produced the patterned distributions that archaeologists identify in these data. To decode the behav- ioural significance of these behavioural traces archaeologists need to investigate both the relationship between the material re mains created by an infinitely variable set of behavioural epi- sodes and the patterns and trends in these data created over long time spans and to develop a theory of human action over the middle to long term.},

A review of alternative hypotheses to account for these differences supports a combination of kin-ties and larger campsite areas/person to explain the variance, while the gross overall differences in spacing households are structured primarily by the relative effects of predation pressure, which is inversely proportional to both mean distances between households and campsite areas in m2/person.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Two main observations emerge from these experiments, both relevant to palaeolithic studies. One is the very large number of waste flakes and chips produced in making finely finished flint handaxes. The other is that it is possible to define stages in handaxe manufacture from a study of the waste flakes alone.},
